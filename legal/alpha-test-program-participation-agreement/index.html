              BE
              ABLE TO USE THE ALPHA MATERIALS ON OR OFFLINE OR PARTICIPATE IN THE PROGRAM AT ANY TIME. FROM TIME TO
              TIME, PROBLEMS BEYOND STANDARTS’S REASONABLE CONTROL MAY PREVENT OR DELAY YOUR ACCESS TO THE PROGRAM OR

              PROGRAM
              DISCONTINUANCE FOR ANY REASON. ALL OTHER SOFTWARE NOT PUBLISHED BY STANDARTS IS THE SOLE RESPONSIBILITY OF
              THE NAMED PUBLISHER. PLEASE CHECK THE PUBLISHER’S TERMS AND CONDITIONS ASSOCIATED WITH SOFTWARE BEFORE
              PLAYING.&nbsp;</strong><br>

            apply to the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, even if any remedy fails of its essential
            purpose. In no event will STANDARTS or its affiliates be liable for any special, incidental, indirect, or
